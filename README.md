### Programmer Mode
1. Switch to Programmer mode using the mode selector
2. Convert numbers between different bases
3. Perform bitwise operations
4. Use shift operations

### Statistics Mode
1. Switch to Statistics mode using the mode selector
2. Enter data points using the DATA button
3. Calculate statistical measures:
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Standard deviation
   - Variance
   - Min/Max
   - Sum

### Memory Functions
1. Store values using the Memory Store button
2. Recall values using the Memory Recall button
3. Clear memory using the Memory Clear button

### History
